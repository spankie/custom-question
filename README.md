## record label

Build a rest api that will enable a record label make request to retrieve it's artists songs and number of plays on shazam. Getting this data can be done using the RapidAPI Shazam API.

### Expectations

- The Rest API should have an endpoint that will allow one to pass the name of the song and return details of the song along with the number of plays on shazam.
- Several songs might have the same name, so you are expected to return the details of all hits returned from the API that matches the name of song provided.

- You are free to use any library for the REST API routing but not for anything else.

- You don't have to add authentication to your API, this test is mainly to evaluate your understanding of how REST API works and how you use it.
- make sure that tests are written for the API
